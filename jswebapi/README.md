# JSWebAPI

This is my FEW 1.1 JavaScript Web API Project.

I utilize the JS Geolocation and JS File Reader Browser Web API's. I also go further to use the Google Maps API to fetch a JSON File of data about the users location. I convert that JSON file in my code to an object and read the data from it to appen into the DOM allowing the user to see where they are now. The file reader is used to show the user information about their file.

Future Developments: I'm going to add more information about the file you uploaded like it's name, and actual contents within the file.

For the user location, I would like to give them some more useful information based on their locaion, perhaps location based news. Unfortunately, this is very difficult and I have not found anybody who has implemented an API for it.
