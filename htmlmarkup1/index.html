        <h1>Hypertext Markup Language</h1>

        <p>
        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language
        for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style
        Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
        technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
        originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by
            the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you
            did do.

        <p>You’ll spend 2 years learning the ins and outs of computer
        science and product development through building software
        designed to impact real problems. You’ll be learning the
        same technologies, frameworks and design process used by
        tech companies.</p>

        In 2014 we became the first higher educational institution
        to offer college financing through Income Share Agreements.
        You’ll pay tuition as a percent of earnings once you have a
        successful job in tech.
